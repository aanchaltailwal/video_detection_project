## Yolo5 Video Detection with Telegram Bot
Welcome to the Yolo5 Video Detection with Telegram Bot project! This application enables you to perform object detection 
on videos using the potent Yolo5 microservice through a convenient Telegram bot interface.

## Introduction
In this project, we have developed a Telegram bot that allows users to upload videos for object detection. 
The Telegram bot interacts with the Yolo5 microservice, which efficiently processes the video by dividing it into frames and 
conducting object detection on each frame. The detected objects are then conveyed back to the user through the Telegram bot.

## Architecture
The architecture of this project involves two key components:

## Telegram Bot: The Telegram bot service provides an intuitive chat-based interface for users to interact with the application.
Users can upload videos to the bot for object detection.

## Yolo5 Microservice: The Yolo5 microservice is responsible for the video detection process. It processes each frame of the
uploaded video and identifies the objects present in each frame.

## Using the Application
To use the Yolo5 Video Detection with Telegram Bot, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Set up and configure the Telegram bot using the provided code. Make sure to obtain the required Telegram Bot API token.
- Ensure you have the Yolo5 microservice running and accessible. The code for the Yolo5 microservice will be provided in the repository.
- Deploy the Telegram bot and Yolo5 microservice components as needed, depending on your infrastructure and requirements.
- Interact with the Telegram bot by sending it a video file for object detection.
- The Yolo5 microservice will process the video by dividing it into frames and conducting object detection on each frame.
-  The detected objects will be sent back to you via the Telegram bot.
